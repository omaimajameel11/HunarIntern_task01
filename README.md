# HunarIntern_task01
This project is a simple rule-based chatbot created as part of the Hunar Internship Task. The chatbot works on predefined rules and keywords to respond to user inputs, making it a beginner-friendly example of how chatbots can simulate human-like conversations without the use of machine learning or artificial intelligence.

The chatbot can handle basic interactions such as greetings, asking about its name, simple weather-related responses, and providing help instructions. For example, if a user types "hello," "hi," or "hey," the bot replies with a greeting. If the user asks "how are you," the chatbot responds with a predefined message. It can also introduce itself when asked for its name or identity. When the user says "bye" or "goodbye," the chatbot politely ends the conversation. For anything it doesnâ€™t understand, it replies with a fallback message asking the user to rephrase.

The project is implemented in Python using basic conditional statements. It does not rely on external libraries, which makes it lightweight and easy to run on any system with Python 3 installed. Running the chatbot simply requires executing the script, after which the bot will greet the user and wait for input. The conversation continues in a loop until the user decides to exit by typing "bye."

This task helped me understand the logic behind rule-based systems and how chatbots function at their most basic level. I learned how simple keyword matching can drive conversations and how fallback responses are important when handling unknown inputs. While this chatbot is basic, it lays the foundation for building more advanced conversational agents in the future.

In the future, this chatbot can be extended with more rules to cover additional topics, or it can be integrated with external APIs to fetch live information such as weather updates or news. Another possible improvement would be developing a graphical user interface or deploying the bot as a web application to make it more interactive.

This project was created and submitted as part of the Hunar Internship, demonstrating the application of programming logic in building real-world tools like chatbots.
